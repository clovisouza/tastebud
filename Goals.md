#Goals

# Why? #

Because, I've built two sites that are essentially just blogs based on Django.  I need to build two more.  I realized I was repeating a bunch of patterns, so I thought I'd make it a semi-general project I could install quickly.  I like punching buttons and watching things take off on their own.

# Why not just use Wordpress? #

Yeah, totally.  My blog http://weblog.lonelylion.com is based on Wordpress.  It's great.
