An extraction and generalization of the code that http://tastebudchicago.com is based on.

You're welcome to use this code as you see fit (subject to the license as described in the source LICENSE file), but you probably won't want to.  This is the world's least featureful blog software.

**It doesn't even have comments.**

Can you really call a blog a blog...if it doesn't have comments?!  Eeep!  No comments!  Impossible!

Now that that hurdle is done with, I use this code, or variations of it, on a few sites.  I like it, probably because I wrote it.

When you download it, it'll be kind of tough to install.  When you're done, it's pretty much going to look **wicked boring**.

_Except_, check out all that space you can drill holes into, it's a blank slate man...get your drill.
